## 
I am an ecologist using quantitative methods to understand how ecosystems respond to environmental change caused by humans.

My research thus far has focused on how plants and wildlife respond to disturbance, specifically fire. I use modeling techniques such as occupancy models, resource selection functions, and species distribution models to understand ecological processes
